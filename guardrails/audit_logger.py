"""
CRRA Lab C4 — Audit Logger

Every step the supervisor takes on a contract is written down: what the agent
looked up, what it recommended, which policy triggers fired, who approved it and
what the final status was. One JSON object per line (JSON Lines), so the file can
be appended to safely and read back with a few lines of Python or pandas.

Usage:
    from guardrails.audit_logger import AuditLogger

    audit = AuditLogger()
    audit.log("analysis", "contract_fetched", contract_id="CTR-1004", annual_value_inr=6200000)
